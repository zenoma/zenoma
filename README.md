### Hi there, I'm AdriÃ¡n ðŸ‘‹

## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm a computer engineer passionate about application development. I have a degree and I'm currently pursuing a Master's in Computer Engineering at the University of A CoruÃ±a. I've completed several personal projects using technologies like Java, SQL, and React, with a standout being my Single Page Application for Forest Brigade Management with Mapbox integration. Additionally, I've worked with HCL Commerce and JSP. I consider myself an outgoing, curious, empathetic, creative, and proactive individual with analytical and problem-solving skills. I enjoy working in teams and constantly learning. My professional goal is to continue growing as a developer, specializing in Backend, SOLID principles, and software architecture, while also designing new projects that provide value and solutions to current issues.
